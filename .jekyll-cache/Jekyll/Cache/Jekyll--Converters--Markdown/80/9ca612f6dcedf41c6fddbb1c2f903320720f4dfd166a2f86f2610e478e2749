        Digital Image Perception is a simplified algorithm to have the perception of depth (or distance) based on the two different images taken at same time from different (but related) perspectives. This project is inspired by the perception of depth (or distances) by human visual system.
        <br /><br />
        We have two visual receptors that capture real world image at same instant but from two related but different perspectives. We will use digital image correlation for most part of the project. We will mostly work on Google Colab.
        <br /><br />
        
        <br /><br />
        However, in this dynamic marketplace, there are no apps/websites which offer consumer-consumer interaction. What if you want to order food with friends? How do you find like-minded friends to go with for a movie?
        <br /><br />
        Technology at hand ignores the social aspect of the marketplace. We seek to address this void by creating ‚ÄúPool-It!‚Äù, a user-driven platform that brings consumers together. Now no more time wasted searching for the ‚Äú10th‚Äù member to avail your group discount!
        <br /><br />
        - Before Pool-It! (real-life): Call a bunch of people to find out whether they are interested. 25% will say they already watched the movie, 25% will say outright that they are not interested, and the rest will spend at least 2 hours coordinating. ( college problems :) ).
        <br /><br />
        - After Pool-It! (utopia): I open ‚ÄúPool-It!‚Äù, select the groups of people I would wish to go with, and wait to get matched. No more coordination!‚Äù
